# Security Policy

I am extremely dedicated to ensuring the security of this library. In order to
ensure that goal, I keep the complexity of the library to an absolute minimum.

There are no production dependencies used by this library.

## Supported Versions

I currently only support `1.2.x` for security updates. The module is still new,
so there are no projects that depend on versions lower than this.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.2   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerability reports will always be handled with absolute priority. The best
way to report a vulnerability is to
[notify NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=unraw), who
will analyze your report and take the appropriate action along with alerting me.
